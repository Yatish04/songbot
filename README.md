# SongBot

This app has a conversational interface to display top charts and play songs as audio or video.

The app uses **Watson Conversation Api**.The Conversation service powers the basic Q&A using _intents, relationships and natural language,_ and calls the **SongBot App**  when it encounters questions it canâ€™t answer. SongBot searches and ranks responses from the manual to answer those questions.
